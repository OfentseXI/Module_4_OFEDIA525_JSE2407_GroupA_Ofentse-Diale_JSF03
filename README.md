## Introduction

Welcome to the JSF 04 Portfolio Piece! This project helped me learn and practice building a web application using Vue, a lightweight and powerful JavaScript framework. In this challenge, I built a real-world E-commerce application from scratch, utilizing Vue's unique features and best practices.

Throughout this project, I learned how to create reusable components, manage state and props, handle events, and more. By the end of this challenge, I had a fully functional web application that showcases my skills and understanding of Vue.

## Technologies

* Vue: A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative, component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces of any complexity.
* JavaScript: The programming language used for building the application
* HTML: Used for structuring.
* TailwindCSS: Used for styling the application.
* Bootstrap/Bootstrap-Icons: A free, open source front-end development framework for the creation of websites and web apps. 
* SweetAlert2: A beautiful, responsive, customizable and accessible (WAI-ARIA) replacement for JavaScript's popup boxes.
* Pinia: A store library for Vue, it allows you to share a state across components/pages. 
* Axios: A popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from a web browser or Node. js.

## Project Overview

This E-commerce application allows users to browse and purchase products from a virtual store. The application features a user-friendly interface, product filtering and sorting, shopping cart functionality, and a checkout process. The application is built using Vue components, with a focus on reusability and maintainability.

Key features of the application include:

* Product listing page with filtering and sorting options
